    <string name="about_me_message">Hello! My name is Alejandro Barrera and I am the creator of this Rick and Morty demo application. To make it, I worked with most of the libraries and architecture patterns used in modern Android development: Retrofit, Room, Paging, Hilt, Jetpack Compose, MVVM and Clean Architecture. It was very interesting to make this demo. I hope you like it! &#x1F604;</string>
